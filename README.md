# jsproject

Background
A 1-2 paragraph description of your project, providing the necessary context for someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it does.

Functionality & MVPs
Fill in this template:

In { project name }, users will be able to:

{ 4-6 core features or functionalites of your project }
{ feature }
{ feature }
{ feature }
{ feature }
In addition, this project will include:

{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
{ other aspect of project }
{ other aspect of project }
Wireframes
Draw the layout of your project: the major sections of the game view, the chart and its legend, the game controls and about me links, etc. This doesn't have to be a fully detailed mockup; it can just be labeled boxes showing the layout of your project. See the Sample Proposal for an example.

Wireframe.cc is a great tool for quickly creating wireframes.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
What technologies, libraries, and APIs will your project use? If you're building a game, you might use native browser technology like the Canvas API, or you might use a library like three.js. If you're doing data visualization, you might use d3 for rendering charts, and an API to fetch data.

If you're still deciding between a few different libraries or APIs, you can list the ones you're considering, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

If your project needs a backend (see below), list that here as well.

Implementation Timeline
Here you will detail what you hope to get done each day for this project. It serves as a roadmap for the upcoming week. You'll have the following days to work on this project:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday Morning
It can be quite hard to estimate how long parts of your project might take. Don't worry if you end up straying from this timeline; the goal is to have a plan in place for what you'll do & in what order, and to have a tentative pace.

You should also be aware that presentations will be Thursday afternoon, and deploying your project to GitHub Pages or Heroku will take some time Thursday morning, so don't plan much for that morning.
