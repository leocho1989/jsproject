# Olympic games medals

Background
Olympic games is happening in Tokyo at the moment, I am a big volleyball fan and like watching olympic games, especially volleyball. So I want to make a data visualization of Olympic games medals information.


Functionality & MVPs

In Olympic games medals, users will be able to:

1. Users can view medals data in years(specific host country),ranked by total medals won.
2. Users can view medals data by different countries, with competition details including individual winners and winning score.
3. Users can view data in different sports categories.
4. Users can view medal performance for an individual athlete in Olympics.

In addition, this project will include:

An About modal describing the background and rules of the game
A production README

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
What technologies, libraries, and APIs will your project use? If you're building a game, you might use native browser technology like the Canvas API, or you might use a library like three.js. If you're doing data visualization, you might use d3 for rendering charts, and an API to fetch data.

If you're still deciding between a few different libraries or APIs, you can list the ones you're considering, and the potential benefits and drawbacks of each.

If your project needs a backend (see below), list that here as well.

Implementation Timeline
Here you will detail what you hope to get done each day for this project. It serves as a roadmap for the upcoming week. You'll have the following days to work on this project:

Friday Afternoon & Weekend
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday Morning
It can be quite hard to estimate how long parts of your project might take. Don't worry if you end up straying from this timeline; the goal is to have a plan in place for what you'll do & in what order, and to have a tentative pace.

You should also be aware that presentations will be Thursday afternoon, and deploying your project to GitHub Pages or Heroku will take some time Thursday morning, so don't plan much for that morning.
